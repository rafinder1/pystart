## Range in python:
```
range(start, limit, step)
```
#### Limit is not include to range
#### If you do not add start - default value is equal 0
#### If you do not add step - default value is equal 1

### Examples:
#### number range from 99 to 110
```
tuple(range(99, 111))
```
#### number even range from 100 to 140
```
tuple(range(100, 141, 2))
```
#### number even range from 100 to 140
```
tuple(range(100, 141, 2))
```
#### all numbers divisible by 3 from 3 to 33
```
tuple(range(3, 34, 3))
```
